# Used-Car-Price
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning model designed to predict the price of **used cars**. This project was developed as part of the **KaggleX Fellowship** competition. The model leverages various features of the cars, such as make, model, year, and more, to accurately estimate their market price.

# Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and insights to understand data distributions and relationships.
* **Model Training:** Multiple models evaluated, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model parameters using Grid Search and Random Search techniques.
* **Model Evaluation:** Detailed evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
